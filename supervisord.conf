[supervisord]
# The path to the activity log of the supervisord process. 
# This option can include the value %(here)s, which expands to the 
# directory in which the supervisord configuration file was found.
logfile=/home/budi/supervisord.log

# The maximum number of bytes that may be consumed by the activity log file 
# before it is rotated (suffix multipliers like “KB”, “MB”, and “GB” can be 
# used in the value). 
# Set this value to 0 to indicate an unlimited log size.
logfile_maxbytes=50MB

# The number of backups to keep around resulting from 
# activity log file rotation. 
# If set to 0, no backups will be kept.

# The logging level, dictating what is written to the supervisord activity log.
# One of critical, error, warn, info, debug, trace, or blather.
# Note that at log level debug, the supervisord log file will record 
# the stderr/stdout output of its child processes and extended info info 
# about process state changes, which is useful for debugging a process 
# which isn’t starting properly. 
loglevel=info

# The location in which supervisord keeps its pid file.
# This option can include the value %(here)s, which expands 
# to the directory in which the supervisord configuration file was found.

# If true, supervisord will start in the foreground instead of daemonizing.
nodeamon=false

# The minimum number of file descriptors that must be available before 
# supervisord will start successfully. 
# A call to setrlimit will be made to attempt to raise the soft and hard limits
# of the supervisord process to satisfy minfds.
# The hard limit may only be raised if supervisord is run as root. 
# supervisord uses file descriptors liberally, and will enter a failure mode 
# when one cannot be obtained from the OS, so it’s useful to be able to 
# specify a minimum value to ensure it doesn’t run out of them during 
# execution. 
# This option is particularly useful on Solaris, which has a low per-process 
# fd limit by default.
minfds=1024

# The minimum number of process descriptors that must be available 
# before supervisord will start successfully. A call to setrlimit will be 
# made to attempt to raise the soft and hard limits of the supervisord 
# process to satisfy minprocs. The hard limit may only be raised if 
# supervisord is run as root. supervisord will enter a failure mode 
# when the OS runs out of process descriptors, so it’s useful to 
# ensure that enough process descriptors are available upon 
# supervisord startup.

# Prevent supervisord from clearing any existing AUTO chlild log files 
# at startup time. Useful for debugging.

# supervisord configuration file was found.

# If supervisord is run as the root user, switch users to this UNIX user 
# account before doing any meaningful processing. This value has no effect 
# if supervisord is not run as root. Default value = current user

# Strip all ANSI escape sequences from child log files.
strip_ansi=false

# A list of key/value pairs in the form KEY="val",KEY2="val2" that will 
# be placed in the supervisord process’ environment (and as a result in 
# all of its child process’ environments). This option can include the 
# value %(here)s, which expands to the directory in which the supervisord 
# configuration file was found. Values containing non-alphanumeric 
# characters should be quoted (e.g. KEY="val:123",KEY2="val,456"). 
# Otherwise, quoting the values is optional but recommended. 
# To escape percent characters, simply use two. (e.g. URI="/first%%20name") 
# Note that subprocesses will inherit the environment variables of the 
# shell used to start supervisord except for the ones overridden here 
# and within the program’s environment option. Default value = no value
#environment=

# The identifier string for this supervisor process, used by the RPC 
# interface.

# The URL that should be used to access the supervisord server, 
# e.g. http://localhost:9001. For UNIX domain sockets, use 
# unix:///absolute/path/to/file.sock.

# This should be same as username from the supervisord server configuration 
# for the port or UNIX domain socket you’re attempting to access.
username=budi

# The password to pass to the supervisord server for use in authentication. 
# This should be the cleartext version of password from the supervisord

# passwords specified in this file, it must be provided in cleartext.

# A path to use as the readline persistent history file. If you enable
